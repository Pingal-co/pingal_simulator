# pingal-simulator

> A Vue.js project

I am developing this Desktop and Web Simulator app to test the backend (especially, the pingal_brain). 
This is a port of essential components in pingal_chat (react-native). 
If everything works, we can also use this as a fully functional desktop/web app.
 
## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

Vue.js is like React, has a much lower learning curve, and is fun. I learned it by following:
- [official guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) and 
- [this tutorial](https://coligo.io/learn-vuex-by-building-notes-app/).
